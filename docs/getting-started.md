## Getting Started

The library is structured into the following directories:

| Directory | Information  |
|-----------|--------------|
| `src`     | source code; implementation of port-Hamiltonian formulation |
| `include` | headers; the public interface of the library                |
| `demos`   | the testcase demos |

To use the code, you must first set the environment and dependent libraries.
Instructions provided here are provided for standard UNIX distributions, but maybe easily adopted (but not tested) in other operating systems.
